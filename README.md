# Drag-and-Drop-Form-Builder 

In this assignment, I have built a visual form designer that dynamically renders a form based on the provided JSON data. Users can add, 
reorder, and delete form elements, including inputs, selects, and textareas. The form will facilitate seamless editing of labels and placeholders, along with 
the option to manage select options. Upon saving, the updated form structure will be logged in the console.

## Features

- **Add Form Elements:** Users can add new inputs, selects, or textareas to the form, allowing for any number of each element.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Users can reorder the form elements using drag-and-drop functionality to customize the layout.
- **Delete Elements:** Users can delete existing form elements as needed.
- **Save and Log:** A "Save" button will log the updated JSON structure of the form in the developer tools console.
- **Edit Labels, Placeholders and Selects:** Users can edit the labels, placeholders,options for inputs, textareas, select to customize the content.
- **Responsive UI Design:** Ensure responsive UI design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** Html, Css, Javascript.
